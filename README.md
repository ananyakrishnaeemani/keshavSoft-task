# KeshavSoft – Bootstrap 5 UI Project
This is a responsive, multi-page website built using Bootstrap 5. The project demonstrates the use of core Bootstrap components with modern layout practices. It is created as part of an internship assignment to showcase frontend design and Bootstrap proficiency.

## Overview
The site presents a fictional company "KeshavSoft" and includes three primary pages:

- Home – Introduction to the brand and core services
- About – Company story, values, milestones, and team members
- Contact – Inquiry form and contact information

The content is structured using Bootstrap’s grid system, card components, responsive utilities, and accessible design principles. All assets and code are neatly organized and deployed using standard web development conventions.

## Tools and Frameworks Used
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Responsive grid system and utility classes
- No external JavaScript libraries beyond Bootstrap's own bundle

## Design Considerations
- Used consistent spacing, padding, and alignment across all sections
- Responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
-Components such as cards, buttons, and forms are reused for consistency
-Custom CSS is minimal and only used where Bootstrap utilities were insufficient

## Deployment
This project can be hosted using any static site host such as GitHub Pages or Netlify. No backend or database is required.
